Customised Scheduling:

Jobs with the least remaining time will be prioritised over longer jobs, weight is put on old jobs
    Good when there are some of small jobs inbetween large jobs;
    The weight/offset to large jobs means that they will eventually finish even if there are a lot of small jobs.
    If there are a lot of larger jobs, then smaller jobs (possibly io) might be impeded after a while because older jobs will impede them.
    this is still better than simple shortest job first

Customised Memory:

Jobs that have the longest time remaining will be evicted first.
Good when there are lots of small jobs, which will mean that they don't get evicted.
Large jobs are already going to have their pages deallocated anyway;
and the percentage is small since most of the running time won't be spent on memory.
Smaller jobs won't get impeded by this, and once a job has almost completed it won't need to reallocate pages.

Bad when there are too many small jobs inbetween large jobs.
Larger jobs might get impeded a lot, but as loading time doesn't count towards the quantum the job will eventually finish.
