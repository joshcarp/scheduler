Customised Scheduling:
- Jobs with the least remaining time will be prioritised over longer jobs
    - good when there are some of small jobs inbetween large jobs
    - bad when there are too many small jobs inbetween large jobs; in this case large jobs will never finish
Customised Memory:
- Jobs that have the longest time remaining will be evicted first
 - good when there are lots of small jobs, which will mean that they don't get evicted
 - bad when there are too many small jobs inbetween large jobs
